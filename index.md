# Welcome to SDG Games

Hello! My name is Matthew, and I have a slightly crazy vision for a games studio.


A lot of people out there focus on making games. Some (usually larger) studios focus on making money through games. I am designing a studio around the sole goal of making a difference through games.

I know, that sounds cheesy. But I’m doing my best to ensure that every single detail supports this vision. For that reason, SDG Games (from the Latin “Soli Deo Gloria”)  might look a little different from your average Indie Games studio.

First off, I want every game I make to say something important. There are a lot of negative stereotypes around gamers and the games industry, and I want to meet them head-on. I would rather create a game that changes a single person’s life than create a game that sells a million copies (although, I wouldn’t mind if I can do both!)
Second, my games are always Free or PWYW (pay what you want) so everyone can afford to play. Any proceeds I do make will be directly reinvested into charities I believe in or reinvested into the gaming community. I don’t need the money; I already have a day job.
Finally, my games are always Open Sourced, so anyone can contribute. I have a lot of ideas for games that I am, frankly, incapable of making by myself, and I hope that others will get excited and join the cause over time.
I started small and am taking on projects that are at my current skill level. Currently, I am producing Telemachus, my first major game so far.

### What does Soli Deo Gloria mean?
Soli Deo Gloria. The phrase means “Glory to God alone.” While it became well-known during the Reformation, the phrase actually found its origin with artists and musicians (Bach, Handel, and others) who would sign their work with the letters “S.D.G.” as a reminder that the work they did was not for their own glory.
